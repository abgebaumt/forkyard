# Changelog

All notable changes to Forkyard are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Crash reports: the app now keeps a redacted log (`logs/forkyard.log` in the data folder). If it
  panics or ends without shutting down, it saves a report there and offers it on the next start
  (View, Save…, Discard; also “Show crash reports” in the command palette). Nothing is uploaded.

### Changed

- Redaction also removes bare GitHub (`ghp_…`, `github_pat_…`) and GitLab (`glpat-…`) tokens.

## [1.0.0] – 2026-10-13

First public release.
